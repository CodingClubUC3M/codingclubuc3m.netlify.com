abstract = "In this session I will try to show some utilities present in the web. One of them will help us to execute R code from the web, using an online compiler, without installing any kind of software in our computers. The other one, it can help us to solve optimization problems by a graphics way. We can draw the restrictions, the feasible region, and others elements that we can need to solve the problems. Finally, I will show other helpful options for teaching."
