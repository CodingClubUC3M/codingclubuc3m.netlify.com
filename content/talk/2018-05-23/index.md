abstract = "The first time you read about the Julia language, the idea that sticks in your mind is \"A speed similar to C, with a simplicity similar to MATLAB or R\". And in that sentence, the key point is the word \"similar\", because the differences in the language with MATLAB or R might be quite stressful when things do not work as expected. This talk is just a summary of ideas and code with which I would have wished to be introduced into this language to avoid some headaches and scary error messages."
