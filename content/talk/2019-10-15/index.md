abstract = """Iteration is a key feature of every programing language and mastering it will make your life easier. In this talk we will learn how to combine C++ and R: it will help you to manage recursion efficiently and to eliminate bottlenecks in your code. We will also talk briefly about creative coding as well as strange attractors: a beautiful mathematical creature that can produce awesome images."""
