abstract = "The main goal of this session is to show a regular R user how to develop his/her own interactive (web) application without much effort. For doing so, we introduce the Shiny R package that makes this task simple even for an R programmer that has never heard about HTML, CSS or JavaScript (or does not care about them at all). During the session, we will develop from scratch an interactive app that illustrates the law of large numbers. This will allow us to understand the input and output of a Shiny app, as well as the whole workflow intuition for building Shiny apps."
