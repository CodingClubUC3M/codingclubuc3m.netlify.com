abstract = """In this talk, we will build a simple blog using R-Markdown, Jekyll and GitHub pages. We will use the `blogdown` package for R that allows to easily build a personal blog containing scientific contents, such as professional plots (made by `ggplot2`) and mathematical formulas.

The choice for GitHub pages allows to build a blog for free and without any need of a personal server. The talk will show a simple and ready to use workflow to make and handle a personal blog. Then, depending on time, it will address stylistic issues and/or advanced content publications."""
