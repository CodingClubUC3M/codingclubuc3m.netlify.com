abstract = "The main goal of this session is to **show how researchers can use a system control version like Git through GitHub** in order to improve how they keep different versions of their projects and papers. During this fully practical workshop we will review the usage of these tools from scratch. At the end of this session, attendees will learn how to **save different versions of their projects and papers**, **compare them between different dates**, **recover previous versions**, and **handle collaborations** of a project modified during months by different authors."
