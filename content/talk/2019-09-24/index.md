In this talk, we are going to explain how to do presentations in different output formats using one of the easiest and most exhaustive statistical software, R. Now, it is possible create Beamer, PowerPoint, or HTML presentations, including R code, LaTeX equations, graphics, or interactive content.

After the tutorial, you will be able to create R presentations on your own with R Markdown in RStudio. But don't worry if you don't know a lot of R Markdown, because it's really simple to use it with RStudio and you will discover the keys to master the language."""
