abstract = """JupyterLab can be viewed as the evolution of the Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source web application that allows combining interactive code (Python, R, Matlab, C++, etc.), equations, text and rich outputs. JupyterLab provides full support for Jupyter Notebooks and add powerful capabilities, such as text editors, terminals, data file viewers, interactive plotting, etc. In this session we will provide a brief overview of the main capabilities of JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks with a focus on Data Science applications."""
