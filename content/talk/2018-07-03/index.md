abstract = "TensorFlow has been widely used for many applications in machine learning and deep learning. However, TensorFlow is more than that, it is a general purpose computing library. Based on that, people have created a rich ecosystem for quickly developing models. In this talk, I will show how statisticians can get most of the main features in TensorFlow such as automatic differentiation, optimization, and Bayesian analysis through a simple linear regression example."
