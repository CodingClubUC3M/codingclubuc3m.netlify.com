abstract = """Network analysis offers a perspective of the data that broadens and enriches any investigation. Many times we deal with data in which the elements are related, but we have them in a tabulated format that is difficult to import into network analysis tools.

Relationship data require a definition of nodes and connections. Both parts have different structures and it is not possible to structure them in a single table, at least two would be needed. Data analysis tools define different input formats, one of them is GDF, which is characterized by its simplicity and versatility.

In this session, we will see how we can extract the relationships between elements of a file in CSV format to generate a file in GDF format to work with Gephi."""
