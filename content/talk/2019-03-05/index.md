abstract = """In this talk, we will learn to use ggplot2, an R-package to make nice and useful visualizations. The package is based on a powerful and flexible structure (called the Grammar of Graphics). This structure will let us create simple data visualizations in a concise and simple way, and also complex visualizations with practically the same effort. 

Along the talk, we will answer some questions: Why ggplot2? How does it work? Can I use it in my research?

Hence, at the end we will be able to create complex and informative plots with the ggplot2 package, and understand why the Grammar of Graphics is so powerful and flexible in practice."""
