abstract = "As the title reads, in this heterogeneous session we will see three topics of different interest. The first is a collection of three simple and useful one-function R packages that I use regularly in my coding workflow. The second collects some approaches to handling and performing linear regression with big data. The third brings in the freaky component: it presents tools to display graphical information in plain ASCII, from bivariate contours to messages from Yoda!"
