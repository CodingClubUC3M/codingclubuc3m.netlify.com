## When, Where, Why, How

We meet bi- or tri-weekly (see [past sessions](/talk/)) at the Department of
Statistics, either in Leganés or Getafe.

- We like coding and keeping up-to-date in the most recent advances and methodologies.
- We want to exchange knowledge between colleagues and benefit from their expertise.
- We look forward to learn better tools for teaching and presenting results.
- It is funnier to learn with more people than on your own!

Sessions are held in a room equipped with a projector and spots for laptops.
The idea is that attendees bring their own laptops to the session to follow a
reproducible tutorial. The main topic of the session is communicated by email a
week before.

In ~60 minutes, the speaker presents a topic they may think it is of interest
using materials with reproducible code. Attendees follow the materials and may
ask questions on the go. The presentation is informal and the speaker’s goal is
to deliver the key insights behind the code, useful tricks and patches to common
errors.

The materials for each session are [hosted in this website as posts](/post/).
Each post will be solely authored by the presenter, hence providing a proof of
participation. Also, the post may contain possible follow-ups and comments to
the sessions.
